Riker is the Number One music player for MusicBrainz users.

Or, at least it will be. Right now it's not done. But you can help test it or
develop it! Since you can see this, I'll assume you already have a git
checkout. Or maybe you're reading this on a website, in which case you should
go get a git checkout. Go ahead, I'll wait for you to come back.

Anyways, before you can build Riker you'll need two things. First (and hardest)
is libmusicbrainz-4. Your distribution probably does /not/ have it packaged.
(No, the ubuntu libmusicbrainz4c2-whatever package is not libmusicbrainz-4).
So go to http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libmusicbrainz and install it.

Next you'll need the Vala compiler, valac. Version 0.14 should do it, this
should be in your distribution packages. Also sqlite 3, glib, and gstreamer.
Don't forget their associated development packages, if your Linux distribution
has a habit of inconveniencing people who like to actually /use/ their
computers.

Still with me? Now we're ready to go. cd into the riker source directory, and
run these commands:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

And you'll have it built. Or maybe not; in which case you have some errors to
help me fix.

There are two test applications that are currently built. First: tagread
To run it:
./tagread file:///home/user/Music/your-fav-song.mp3

It'll print a bunch of info about setting up the database, then read the 
tags from the file. Then it does a MusicBrainz webservice lookup, and prints
out the information. Then you realize that it didn't actually do anything with
the database, so why did it bother setting it up? I'll get to that later.

The second application might be more interesting: add_artist
To run it:
./add_artist <artist mbid>
(Or if you don't remember any artist MBIDs offhand, I included a default:)
./add_artist

It'll go and set up the database (if you've already run tagread it'll be faster the second time, since the database schema is already set up), then look up an
artist. If the artist is not in the db, it'll query the MusicBrainz webservice
for info and add the artist to the db.
Try running it twice on the same artist.

And... that's it. It will be a music player eventually, I promise.
If you help, we can get there faster :)
